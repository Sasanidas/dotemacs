** Introduction

This is my emacs configuration, where this README is meant to be a form of literate programming.  The entire configuration is one file =~/.emacs.d/init.el= and aims to provide you with a barebones configuration with sane defaults, built upon =package.el=.

** Installation

To install, it's recommended to clone this repo wherever you prefer and symlink the directory to =~/.emacs.d=.

: git clone https://github.com/jonathanchu/dotemacs.git

There is a =Makefile= provided that will create the symlink for you at =~/.emacs.d=:

: make setup

** Packages

=package.el= is new in Emacs 24 and is the package manager library for ELPA (Emacs Lisp Package Archive). =package.el= makes it easy to install, update, and remove third-party packages with ease.  It essentially has removed my need for a =vendor= directory to keep these third-party libraries separate.

The following snippet tells Emacs to use =package.el= and to use Marmalade and the excellent MELPA as the package index.

: (require 'package)
:
: (add-to-list 'package-archives
:              '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/"))
: (add-to-list 'package-archives
:              '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/"))
:
: (package-initialize)
