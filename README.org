* My Emacs Configuration

This is my emacs configuration, where this README is meant to be a form of literate programming.  The entire configuration is one file =~/.emacs.d/init.el= and aims to provide you with a barebones configuration with sane defaults, built upon =package.el=.

TODO
1) Initial setup config
2) Packages
3) Global config
4) Functinos
5) Modes
6) Key bindings
