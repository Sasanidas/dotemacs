** Introduction

This is my emacs configuration, where this README is meant to be a form of literate programming.  The entire configuration is one file =~/.emacs.d/init.el= and aims to provide you with a barebones configuration with sane defaults, built upon =package.el=.

** TODO
- [ ] Initial setup config
- [ ] Packages
- [ ] Global config
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] Modes
- [ ] Key bindings
