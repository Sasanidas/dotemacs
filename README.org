** Introduction

This is my emacs configuration, where this README is meant to be a form of literate programming.  The entire configuration is one file =~/.emacs.d/init.el= and aims to provide you with a barebones configuration with sane defaults, built upon =package.el=.

** Installation

To install, it's recommended to clone this repo wherever you prefer and symlink the directory to =~/.emacs.d=.

: git clone https://github.com/jonathanchu/dotemacs.git

There is a =Makefile= provided that will create the symlink for you at =~/.emacs.d=:

: make setup
